# SodaDetection

## How to run: 

1. Clone this repository
2. Enter the folder "SodaDetection" by typing cd HandTracker
Type ./main.py to run
You can also zip this, and then go to the location in your computer where you unzipped it. Overthere, you would type main.py to run

## How it works:

* Open CV2 is used to differentiate between a pepsi and coke bottle
* One window called "mask" opens showing how the algorithm changes the colors of the image
* The final image with boxes around the soda can have also been changed
* You can replace image.jpg with another picture of a pepsi and code bottle if you would like to
